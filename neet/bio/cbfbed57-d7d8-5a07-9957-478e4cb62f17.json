Of these, habitat loss and fragmentation is generally considered the most significant cause, as it directly affects the availability of the resources and space that organisms need to survive. It can be caused by a variety of human activities, including deforestation, urbanization, and agriculture. This loss of habitat leads to smaller, more isolated populations, which are more vulnerable to other threats and have a higher risk of extinction.</p>\n"

However, the feminine development is also expressed.\nPeople with Klinefelter syndrome are male (XY), but they often have certain physical characteristics that may be typically associated with female development, such as wider hips, less body hair, and sometimes breast tissue development. </p>\n<p>E.

However, there are cases where fertility treatments can help some men with Klinefelter syndrome to father children.</p>\n<p>For the other options :</p>\n<p>A. This disorder was first described by Langdon Down (1866).\nThis is incorrect. Klinefelter&#39;s syndrome was first described by Dr. Harry Klinefelter in the 1940s, not by Langdon Down.</p>\n<p>C. The affected individual is short statured.\nThis is incorrect. In fact, individuals with Klinefelter&#39;s syndrome are often taller than average.</p>\n<p>D. Physical, psychomotor and mental development is retarded.\nThis is also incorrect.

Low temperatures can slow down enzyme activity but do not typically denature the enzyme, essentially preserving it in an inactive state. High temperatures, on the other hand, can cause the enzyme (which is a protein) to denature, or lose its structure, which leads to a loss of enzymatic activity.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Statement II : When the inhibitor closely resembles the substrate in its molecular structure and inhibits the activity of the enzyme, it is known as a competitive inhibitor.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>This statement is also true. A competitive inhibitor is a substance that binds to the active site of an enzyme, preventing the substrate from binding and thus inhibiting the enzyme&#39;s activity. Because it competes with the substrate for the same active site, a competitive inhibitor often has a structure that closely resembles that of the substrate.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>So, the correct answer is :</p>\n<p>Option D : Both Statement I and Statement II are true.</p>"

During the S phase (synthesis phase) of interphase, DNA replication occurs, and the centrosome, which plays a key role in cell division, also duplicates.
